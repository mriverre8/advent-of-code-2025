# Advent of Code 2025 🎄

This repository contains my solutions for **Advent of Code 2025**, written in **JavaScript** and executed using **Node.js**.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

Each Advent of Code day has its own folder following this pattern:

```
day_X/
  ├─ part-1.js
  ├─ part-2.js
```

* `X` represents the day number (e.g., `day_1`, `day_2`, etc.).
* Each part is implemented in its own file.

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Solutions

Make sure you have **Node.js** installed.

1. Navigate into the desired day folder:

```bash
cd day_X
```

2. Run the corresponding part:

```bash
node part-1.js
node part-2.js
```

Each file is meant to be executed directly using Node.

## ✅ Progress

* Completed up to **Day 7 – Part 1**
* Received **a little help** with:

  * **Day 6 – Part 2**

All other completed parts were solved independently.
