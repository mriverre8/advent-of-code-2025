# Advent of Code 2025 🎄

This repository contains my solutions for [**Advent of Code 2025**](https://adventofcode.com/)

I made this mainly for learning, practicing, and getting better at solving problems.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each Advent of Code day has its own folder following this pattern:

```
day_n/
  ├─ part-1.js
  ├─ part-2.js
```

- `n` represents the day number (e.g., `day_1`, `day_2`, etc.).
- Each part is implemented in its own file.

1. Navigate into the desired day folder:

```bash
cd day_X
```

2. Run the corresponding part:

```bash
node part-1.js
node part-2.js
